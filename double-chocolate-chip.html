    <p>These soft-baked thick and chunky cookies are as indulgent as they 
      look: rich and fudge-like with chewy centers, slightly crisp edges, 
      and oodles of melty chocolate chips in each glorious bite. The dough 
      needs to chill for at least 3 hours, but you can make it ahead of 
      time and refrigerate overnight.¬†</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup (115g)</strong> unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup (100g)</strong> granulated sugar</li>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup (100g)</strong> packed brown sugar</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> large egg, room temperature</li>
      <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li><strong>1 cup (125g)</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
      <li><strong>2/3 cup (55g)</strong> natural unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> baking soda</li>
      <li><strong>1/8 teaspoon</strong> salt</li>
      <li><strong>1 Tablespoon (15ml)</strong> milk</li>
      <li><strong>1 and 1/4 cups (225g)</strong> semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer fitted with a 
        paddle attachment, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown 
        sugar together on medium high speed until fluffy and light in 
        color, about 2-3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and 
        then beat on high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and 
        bottom of the bowl as needed.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda 
        and salt together until combined. With the mixer running on low 
        speed, slowly pour into the wet ingredients. Beat on low until 
        combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick. Switch to high 
        speed and beat in the milk, then the chocolate chips. The cookie 
        dough will be sticky and tacky. Cover dough tightly and chill in 
        the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling 
        is mandatory for this sticky cookie dough.</li>
      <li>Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at 
        room temperature for 10 minutes. If the cookie dough chilled 
        longer than 3 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 
        20 minutes. This makes the chilled cookie dough easier to scoop 
        and roll.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350¬∞F (177¬∞C). Line large baking sheets with 
        parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Scoop and roll dough, a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each, 
        into balls. To ensure a thicker cookie, make the balls taller 
        than they are wide (almost like a cylinder or column). Arrange 
        2-3 inches apart on the baking sheets. The cookie dough is 
        certainly sticky, so wipe your hands clean after every few balls 
        of dough you shape.</li>
      <li>Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear 
        set and the centers still look soft. Tip: If they aren't really 
        spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly 
        bang the baking sheet on the counter 2-3x. This helps initiate 
        that spread. Return to the oven to continue baking.</li>
      <li>Cool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. During this 
        time, I like to press a few more chocolate chips into the 
        tops of the warm cookies. (This is optional and only for looks.) 
        Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely. The cookies will 
        slightly deflate as they cool.</li>
    </ol>
