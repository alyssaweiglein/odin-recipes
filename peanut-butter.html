      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 and 1/3 cups (170g)</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> baking soda</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 teaspoon</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup (1 stick; 115g)</strong> unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup (100g)</strong> packed brown sugar</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup (50g)</strong> granulated sugar, plus <strong>1/2 cup (100g)</strong> for rolling</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> large egg, room temperature</li>
        <li><strong>3/4 cup (about 185g)</strong> creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> pure vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h3>Directions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. 
          Set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, 
          beat the butter for 1 minute on high speed until creamy. Switch to 
          medium-high speed and beat in the brown sugar and 1/4 cup (50g) 
          granulated sugar until completely creamed and smooth, about 2 minutes. 
          Add the egg and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the 
          sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the peanut butter and vanilla 
          extract and beat until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on low speed 
          until combined. The dough will be very creamy and soft. Cover and chill 
          the cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours, and up to 3 
          days.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment 
          paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
        <li>Roll & coat the dough: Place remaining 1/2 cup (100g) of sugar into a 
          bowl. Roll chilled cookie dough into balls, about 1 scant Tablespoon 
          (5/8 ounce or 18g) of dough each. Roll each ball in the sugar and 
          arrange on baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Use a fork to make a 
          criss-cross indent on top of each. To prevent the cookies from over-spreading, 
          after indenting the cookies, use your fingers to reshape into a thicker 
          disc (since indenting the balls flattened them out).</li>
        <li>Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set and are very lightly 
          browned. The centers will still look very soft.</li>
        <li>Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, 
          transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
      </ol>
