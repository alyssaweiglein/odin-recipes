    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Snickerdoodles are soft, slightly tangy cookies coated in cinnamon-sugar. 
      Because they're rolled and covered in cinnamon-sugar, snickerdoodles 
      tend to have a cracked appearance when they're fully baked. Nobody 
      quite knows where the cookie got its name, but some speculate it comes 
      from "schneckennudel" (a cinnamon-spiked German dessert). </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C). Line two large cookie sheets with 
        parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Make the topping: Combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon 
        together in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Make the cookies: Whisk the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, 
        cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a 
        paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together 
        on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, 
        egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. 
        Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber 
        spatula as needed. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the 
        dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 3 different parts. The dough 
        will be thick.</li>
      <li>Roll cookie dough into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons of cookie dough 
        each. Roll the dough balls in cinnamon-sugar topping. Sprinkle extra 
        cinnamon-sugar on top if desired. Arrange 3 inches apart on the baking 
        sheets.</li>
      <li>Bake cookies for 10 minutes. The cookies will be very puffy and soft. 
        When they are still very warm, lightly press down on them with the back 
        of a spoon or fork to help flatten them out. Allow cookies to cool on 
        the baking sheet for 10 minutes and transfer to a wire rack to cool 
        completely.</li>
    </ol>
